* Issue: [1](https://github.com/mi-classroom/mi-master-wt-beiboot-2023/issues/1)
* Date: 2023-04-19

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to display the augmented reality objects as described in the issue, the project is in need of a web-framework which can be used for AR.

## Considered Options

* [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev)
* [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/)
* [8th Wall](https://www.8thwall.com)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "WebXR", because it is free, widely compatible, and standardized by the W3C (amongst others). "Big Players" like Google, Meta or Mozilla are working on the specification, providing a solid base for future-proofness.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### WebXR

* Good, because it is free to use
* Good, because there are a lot of people using WebXR for their projects. As a result of this, there are a lot of resources about this framework to be found on the web
* Good - because it is a standardisation effort by the W3C and some of the largest tech companies, the future-proofness is safer than with the other options.

### AR.js

* Good, because it is free to use
* Bad, because it is maintained by a handful of developers and does not have big organizations or corporations as a support.

### 8th Wall

* Bad, because there a lot of costs connected with the usage.
* Bad, because it uses its own web-editor, and learning to fluently use a new IDE always takes time.
* Bad, because projects have to be published on 8th Wall's own website exclusively (with the smallest price-package).
